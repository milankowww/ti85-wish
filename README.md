# WISH - WWWs Incredible SHell for USGard 1.5 (standard or lite)

WISH is a shell for USGard. At first, when NOT to use this shell.

Do not use it, if you:

- need memory (it's not made to be small, it's made to fit my wishes)
- require support from author (I'm extremly busy)
- do not have USGard 1.5 (or higher?)

Features:

- APD - auto power-down
- MPD - manual power-down (ON key)
- Contrast change (+/- keys)
- Free mem & size display
- Runs TI-BASIC programs too (requires USGard standard)
- Delete (requires USGard standard)
- CONFIGURABILITY - you can adjust it to satisfy your needs
